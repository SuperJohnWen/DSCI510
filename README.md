# DSCI510

## Introduction
This work is for the Final Project of USC DSCI 510. The goal of this project is to collect data of certain subject by using **API** and **web scrape**. Then do the any analyses on the data.

The aim of my project is to select data about **jobs** and do analyses about them. I specify the collecting data in five types of **tech job** including:
**``Software Development``**, **``Data Science``**, **``Data Analysis``**,**``Software Test``**, and **``Business Analysis``**. Moreover, I also scraped jobs by different keyword of ten programming languages, including **``Python``**, **``Java``**, **``C++``**, **``C#``**, **``TypeScript``**, **``PHP``**, **``Swift``**, **``JavaScript``**, **``Golang``**, **``Kotlin``**


There **some change** from my HW3. I give up collecting data from [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ces/data/employment-and-earnings). Cause i found the 2011-2018 data was in pdf format, not web table which is hard to collect. The other content was no change.

## Datasets
There are **four datasets** in this project and they are sorted in the sqlite database. Every dataset have a **sample_dataset** which is convenient for other people (like grader) to check or run the code in sample mode.

### Pglanguage Dataset
This dataset is collected by [Adzuna API](https://developer.adzuna.com/). This dataset has 10,000 tuples and 9 attributes.
The following table is the information of every attribute
|Attribute|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|**title**|Name of Job|TEXT|
|**category**|category of Job|TEXT|
|**company**|Name of company|TEXT|
